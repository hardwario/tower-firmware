# HARDWARIO TOWER Firmware SDK (Embassy)

An [Embassy](https://embassy.dev) firmware SDK for the **HARDWARIO TOWER Core
Module** (STM32L083CZ). The crate is a **library** of reusable blocks (LED,
button, TMP112 thermometer, LIS2DH12 accelerometer, addressable-LED strip, a
framed host↔target **console** (logs/events/shell), EEPROM storage, USB-gated low
power) plus a **SPIRIT1 sub-GHz radio stack** (secured AES-128-CCM network layer —
confirmed delivery, replay protection, bulk transfer, OTA pairing); flashable
programs live in [`examples/`](examples) and are built/flashed by name with
[`just`](https://just.systems). It also has an **opt-in** signed, A/B **firmware-over-the-air**
update path (`tower::fota` + an embassy-boot bootloader); without it an app links to the full
192 KB flash (no bootloader, no A/B). Each subsystem has a guide:
[`docs/console.md`](docs/console.md), [`docs/radio.md`](docs/radio.md), and
[`docs/fota.md`](docs/fota.md).

## Quick start

```sh
# One-time: cargo install just cargo-binutils   (+ rustup component add llvm-tools)
#           install the `tower` CLI for UART flashing + console (github.com/hardwario/tower-cli)
#           (add probe-rs-tools only for SWD `cargo run`; tower UART flashing needs neither)
just examples                  # list example names      (just apps → product names)
just run example thermometer    # build + flash an example, watch the console from boot
just run app radio_push_button  # same, for a ready-made TOWER IoT Kit product (apps/)
just logs                       # re-attach to a running MCU's framed console (no reset)
```

## Module layout

The library (`src/lib.rs`) exposes these reusable blocks:

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/button.rs` | Debounced button driver (click/hold) over any GPIO; `init_exti` (low-power, sleeps when idle) or `init_polled` (when the EXTI line is taken) |
| `src/console.rs` | Framed host↔target console (`tower-protocol`): `log` backend, `print!`/`println!`, structured `event`s, and chunked shell responses over an interrupt-driven UART — paired with the `tower` host CLI; see [`docs/console.md`](docs/console.md) |
| `src/shell.rs` | RouterOS-style shell with target-authoritative TAB completion and a declarative, EEPROM-backed settings framework (`Str`/`Uint`/`Int`/`Bool`/`Enum`); apps deep-merge their own commands + settings via `serve_ext` — see [`docs/console.md`](docs/console.md) |
| `src/led.rs` | Non-blocking LED blink dispatcher (background pattern + priority instant sequences) |
| `src/lis2dh12.rs` | LIS2DH12 accelerometer (HAL-independent): 10 Hz/normal mode, `dice()` orientation (1–6), and a hardware tilt/movement interrupt with selectable sensitivity + report `min_interval` |
| `src/power.rs` | Notes on the SDK's low-power (STOP) policy; the USB-presence gating itself lives in `console::manager` (see [`docs/console.md`](docs/console.md)) |
| `src/storage.rs` | Non-volatile storage in the data EEPROM: a raw byte area (`read`/`write` at offset) and a key-value store (`Kv`) — values as raw scalars or postcard structs, CRC-framed, updated in place |
| `src/strip.rs` | LED-strip effects over `ws2812`: solid/compound/gradient + rainbow, chase, breathe, scanner, sparkle; brightness 0–100 % with gamma |
| `src/tmp112.rs` | TMP112 driver, generic over `embedded_hal::i2c::I2c` (HAL-independent) |
| `src/ws2812.rs` | WS2812B/SK6812 strip driver (PA1) — TIM2 PWM + DMA, RGB & RGBW, arbitrary length |
| `src/radio/` | SPIRIT1 sub-GHz radio stack: chip driver (SPI/state machine/CSMA/sleep), RF config, hardware AES-128-CCM, frame codec, EU duty governor, and a secured network layer (`net`) with per-peer keys, confirmed delivery, replay protection, bulk transfer and OTA pairing — see [`docs/radio.md`](docs/radio.md) |
| `src/fota/` | Firmware-over-the-air: program-flash staging (`Stage`/`FlashSink`), the node OTA driver (`pull_update`: advertise → pull → stage → stash signed manifest), and the host-proxy image source (`HostProxySource`). The Ed25519 + image-digest install gate runs in the **A/B bootloader** (`crates/bootloader/`, so salty stays out of the duplicated app slots); see [`docs/fota.md`](docs/fota.md) |
| `src/board.rs` | `Board::take()` + `app!` — the common entry: clock, console, TMP112→one-shot, EXTI, radio pins, and USB-aware low power (auto-spawns the USB-gated `console::manager`); logs a uniform `Example booted: <name>` banner and hands the app ready resources |

Also in the workspace: `crates/bootloader/` (the embassy-boot A/B FOTA bootloader) and
`tools/fota-sign/` (host signer, out-of-workspace). The shared wire-format crate
**`tower-protocol`** lives in [its own repo](https://github.com/hardwario/tower-protocol),
pinned here by git tag (and shared with the [`tower-cli`](https://github.com/hardwario/tower-cli)
host). To co-develop it locally without re-tagging, add a `paths` override to your
`~/.cargo/config.toml` (the repo's `.cargo/config.toml` is committed for the build target, so
the override can't live there): `paths = ["/path/to/tower-protocol"]`.

### LED indication

[`led`](src/led.rs) runs a dispatcher task that owns the pin (any GPIO via
embassy's type-erased `Output`, with an `active_high` polarity flag). The app
holds a cheap, copyable [`Led`] handle:

- `set_background(Some(pattern))` — a looping status pattern (`None` clears it).
- `play(sequence)` — a one-shot sequence that **preempts** the background, plays
  once, then the background resumes.
- `set_switch_delay(d)` — the off-gap inserted before an instant sequence
  interrupts a running background, so the two read as distinct (default 250 ms).

Patterns are `'static` slices of `Step` (`Step::on(ms)` / `Step::off(ms)`). The
`blinky` example sets a ~2 s heartbeat background and plays a double-blink every
5 s that preempts it; `button` flashes the LED on click/hold. A background
pattern wakes the MCU once per period even on battery, so clear it when
minimizing STOP power.

## Low power

The firmware runs on embassy-stm32's STOP-mode thread executor instead of the
default `embassy-executor` one. It is selected with the `executor`/`entry`
arguments on the `#[embassy_executor::main]` attribute, and enabled by the
`executor-thread` + `low-power` features on `embassy-stm32` (with the matching
features **removed** from `embassy-executor`, so there is only one `__pender`).

Whenever every task is idle, the executor drops the core into the deepest
available STOP mode. A general-purpose timer keeps `embassy-time` while the core
runs; on entering STOP that time is handed off to the **RTC**, which is clocked
from the LSE crystal (`config.rcc.ls = LsConfig::default_lse()`) and programmed
to fire the wake-up. So during an idle gap the MCU draws ~µA rather than
running continuously (~hundreds of µA). The TMP112 is independently low-power:
one-shot + shutdown keeps it at ~1 µA between conversions.

While USB is connected the board keeps itself awake instead — but via the console
rather than a separate task: [`Board::take`](src/board.rs) auto-spawns the USB-gated
[`console::manager`](src/console.rs), which builds the console UART whenever VBUS (PA12)
is high. On the STM32L0 an enabled USART holds embassy's STOP refcount, so idle drops to
plain Sleep (clocks live, so the console and EXTI stay responsive) rather than STOP.
Unplug and the manager **drops** the UART, releasing the refcount so the executor returns
to STOP; a PA12 edge (or the manager's ~500 ms poll) brings the console back on plug-in.
Every app gets this for free — see [`docs/console.md`](docs/console.md).

Two settings in [`board::init`](src/board.rs) matter here:

- `config.min_stop_pause` (`0`) — STOP threshold. **In embassy-stm32 0.6.0 a
  nonzero value is a hard floor on the shortest awaitable delay, not a power
  knob:** if the next alarm is sooner than the threshold, the time driver skips
  arming the RTC wake-up but the executor still enters STOP, leaving no wake
  source (the TIM is clock-gated) → the core hangs. Setting it to zero hands
  every idle off to the RTC, so any wait length is safe; the RTC alarm clamps
  sub-tick requests to a ~61 µs floor and wakes slightly early (the executor
  re-sleeps), so correctness holds and power stays optimal for realistic waits.
  See the long comment at the `min_stop_pause` assignment for how to turn this
  back into a tunable power knob (requires a fixed/newer embassy-stm32).
- `config.enable_debug_during_sleep` (`false`) — gating the debug clock domain
  is what actually lowers STOP current. Set it to `true` if you need SWD/RTT to
  stay alive while stopped (e.g. for `probe-rs`), at much higher STOP current.

> Keeping the blocking `I2c` alive does not block STOP on the L0: an enabled I2C
> only raises the *minimum* stop refcount, which still permits the L0's single
> STOP mode (it would only forbid the deeper STOP2 that the L0 doesn't have).
> A debug probe attached with `enable_debug_during_sleep = false` will lose the
> core during STOP — measure real current standalone.

## Examples and applications

Flashable programs come in two kinds:

- **Examples** — each file in [`examples/`](examples) is a complete program that demonstrates
  one block. Add your own by dropping a `.rs` there — it's picked up automatically
  (`just examples`). Built as Cargo examples (`just build example <name>`).
- **Applications** — ready-made TOWER IoT Kit product firmwares in [`apps/`](apps) (e.g.
  `radio_dongle_gateway`, `radio_push_button`, `radio_climate_monitor`). These are full
  applications, so they're Cargo binaries: list them with `just apps`, build with
  `just build app <name>`. Add one by dropping `apps/<name>.rs` and a matching `[[bin]]` in
  `Cargo.toml`.

| Example | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| `blinky` | The `led` block — background heartbeat + priority instant blink |
| `button` | The `button` block — log press/release/click/hold, flash the LED |
| `thermometer` | `tmp112` — log the temperature every 2 s |
| `accelerometer` | `lis2dh12` — report die face 1–6 as you turn the board; opt-in tilt alert |
| `strip` | `ws2812` + `strip` — a scrolling rainbow on PA1 |
| `storage` | `storage` — a key-value store in EEPROM: a raw boot counter + a postcard settings struct, surviving reset |
| `i2cscan` | Probe the I2C2 bus and log responding addresses (diagnostic) |

The radio stack adds ~20 more (`radio_*`, `net_*`, `crypto_*`, `edge_*`) — the
reference apps `radio_gateway`/`radio_node` are the happy path; see the full table
and protocol guide in [`docs/radio.md`](docs/radio.md). Two-board examples are one
file built twice with a role feature, e.g. `TOWER_FEATURES=role-gateway just flash
net_confirmed`.

### Writing an app

The `app!` macro supplies the entry point and the always-on board setup —
clock, the serial console, the TMP112 put into one-shot (shutdown) mode, and
USB-aware low power (see above) — logs a uniform `Example booted: <name>` line,
then hands you a [`Board`](src/board.rs) of ready resources. A whole app is just:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]
use tower::{app, board::Board};

async fn run(mut b: Board) {
    // b.spawner, b.tmp112 (shut down), b.led, b.button, b.accel_int, b.storage, b.strip_* …
    loop {
        if let Ok(raw) = b.tmp112.oneshot().await {
            log::info!("{} raw", raw);
        }
    }
}
app!(run);
```

See `thermometer.rs` (≈12 lines of logic) for the minimal real example.

## Build / flash / logs

Prerequisites (one-time): `cargo install just cargo-binutils probe-rs-tools`
and `rustup component add llvm-tools`. `just test` and the FOTA recipes also need
`python3` (`python` on Windows) — see [`docs/fota.md`](docs/fota.md).

`build`/`flash`/`run`/`size` take a kind (`example` or `app`) then the name:

```sh
just examples                        # list example names      (just apps → product names)
just build example blinky            # → target/firmware.bin (+ size)
just flash example blinky            # build + flash over the UART bootloader (tower)
just flash app radio_push_button     # same, for a ready-made TOWER IoT Kit product (apps/)
just run   example thermometer       # build + flash, then stream the framed console logs
just logs                            # stream the framed console from the running MCU (tower logs)
just flash example blinky --no-verify  # extra args pass through to `tower flash`
```

Flashing + console use the [`tower`](https://github.com/hardwario/tower-cli) CLI (it
programs the STM32L0 over the UART bootloader and decodes the framed console); install it
on your `PATH`. Set `TOWER_PORT=/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX` if more than one serial port is
present. `cargo run --release --example blinky` also flashes via the SWD probe-rs runner
in `.cargo/config.toml` if you use a J-Link/ST-Link instead.

`just build KIND NAME` runs `cargo objcopy` (`--example NAME` for `example`, `--bin NAME`
for `app`) → `target/firmware.bin` (linked at `0x08000000`). The console is **framed** (COBS+CRC+postcard), so use
`tower logs` — a raw serial terminal shows binary. `tower logs` reads without resetting
the MCU; **close it before flashing** (`tower flash` needs exclusive port access).

## Tweaking

App-level constants (sensor address, intervals, pixel count, LED patterns, …)
live in each `examples/*.rs` and are meant to be edited or copied. Common knobs:

- **TMP112 address** — `Tmp112::new(i2c, tmp112::ADDR_VPLUS)` (`0x49`, this board
  straps ADD0 → V+); also `ADDR_GND` (`0x48`), `ADDR_SDA`, `ADDR_SCL`.
- **LED / button polarity** — `led::Polarity::ActiveHigh` / `ActiveLow` (same for
  `button::Polarity`).
- **Accelerometer** — `Lis2dh12::new(i2c, lis2dh12::ADDR_DEFAULT)` (`0x19`);
  `Accel::dice()` → face 1–6; tilt is opt-in via the example's `TILT` const
  (`TiltConfig { sensitivity: Sensitivity::{Low,Medium,High,Ultra}, min_interval }`).
  The accelerometer shares the I2C bus with the TMP112 — reclaim it with
  `b.tmp112.release()`.
- **Strip** — `Strip::new(.., LedKind::Rgb | Rgbw, brightness)`; effects take a
  frame counter you advance.
- **Storage** — wrap `b.storage` in `Kv::new(..)` for keyed values:
  `kv.set_bytes(key, &x.to_le_bytes())` / `kv.get_bytes` for scalars, or
  `kv.set(key, &value)` / `kv.get::<T>(key)` (postcard) for structs. Add a new
  `u16` key to persist new data without disturbing existing keys. Or use
  `b.storage.read/write(offset, ..)` for a raw byte layout.
- **I2C speed / pull-ups** — `i2c_config.frequency`, `scl_pullup`/`sda_pullup`.
- **Clock & low power** — all in [`board::init`](src/board.rs): sysclk, RTC
  source, `min_stop_pause`, debug-during-sleep.
- **TMP112 conversion-wait** — `POLL_MS` × `POLL_TRIES` in `src/tmp112.rs`.
